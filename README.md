# CorretorImagemIBA

Simple app, quick and dirty, no need to refactor.

Runs background checks in a few specific folders and add a green background to images.

Formats the images into the 16:9 default with a green canvas in the background and add a "@" at the end of the name. 

If the image has "@" at the end of the name (ex: "example-photo@.png"), skip it.
